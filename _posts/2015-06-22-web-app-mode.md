You can make your website behave like a native web app in iOS and Android devices
by providing links for the icons for each resolution:

<pre><code data-trim class="yaml">
web-app-mode: True

# Icons for Web App mode

icon-36p: "/img/web-app/icon-36p.png"
icon-48p: "/img/web-app/icon-48p.png"
icon-72p: "/img/web-app/icon-72p.png"
icon-96p: "/img/web-app/icon-96p.png"
icon-144p: "/img/web-app/icon-144p.png"
icon-192p: "/img/web-app/icon-192p.png"
</code></pre>
